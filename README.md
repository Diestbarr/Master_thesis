# Master_thesis
Code used for the master's final thesis

The analysis relies on Python's tensorflow, scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, scipy, sympy and matplotlib modules. Particularly, the versions used were:

- tensorflow-gpu: 2.3.0
- scikit-learn: 0.24.2
- numpy: 1.18.5
- pandas: 1.3.4
- scipy: 1.4.1
- sympy: 1.9
- matplotlib: 3.4.3

Besides, as a general rule of thumb, the pickle files containing the datasets must be placed in the same folder as the scripts and jupyter notebooks
